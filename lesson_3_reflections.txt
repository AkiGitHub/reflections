When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I want to do so when I cannot use my local macihne and when I share the work with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because GitHub repository is seen by other people, I want to push my repository after I finish some works.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks copy GitHub repository into a new GitHub repository, Clones copy into a local repository, Branches add a new developmental branch locally.
