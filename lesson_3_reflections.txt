When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I want to do so when I cannot use my local machine and when I share the work with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because GitHub repository is seen by other people, I want to push my repository after I finish some works.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks copy GitHub repository into a new GitHub repository, Clones copy into a local repository, Branches add a new developmental branch locally.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
We can make appropriate marge version manually.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without Git or GitHub, I would take more time for merging because it took more time adjust consistency between multiple versions.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
By using pull request, synchronization between group is easy.
