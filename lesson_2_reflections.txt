What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It generated some directories and files under the directory in which I get init.
I need it to start a version control for the project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
By the staging area, I can separate files which are administrated by git and ones not.
